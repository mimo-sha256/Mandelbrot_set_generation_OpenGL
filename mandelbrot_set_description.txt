The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c does not diverge when iterated
from z=0, i.e., for which the sequence f_{c}(0), f_{c}(f_{c}(0)),etc., remains bounded in absolute value.

Zooming into the Mandelbrot set
Its definition and name are due to Adrien Douady, in tribute to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.

Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and testing, for each sample point c,whether the sequence 
f_{c}(0),f_{c}(f_{c}(0)).... goes to infinity (in practice -- whether it leaves some predetermined bounded neighborhood of 0 
after a predetermined number of iterations). Treating the real and imaginary parts of c as image coordinates on the complex
plane, pixels may then be coloured according to how soon the sequence  |f_{c}(0)|,|f_{c}(f_{c}(0))|.... crosses an arbitrarily
chosen threshold, with a special color (usually black) used for the values of  c for which the sequence has not crossed the
threshold after the predetermined number of iterations (this is necessary to clearly distinguish the Mandelbrot set image from
the image of its complement). If c is held constant and the initial value of  z—denoted by z_{0}—is variable instead.
